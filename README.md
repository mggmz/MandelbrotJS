# MandelbrotJS
JavaScript implementation of the Mandelbrot set. It renders the fractal in real-time with interactive zoom and exploration. The algorithm applies the escape-time method to compute iterations and color mapping efficiently. Resource for learning fractals, computational graphics, and mathematical visualization in JavaScript.
